# JobTracker
Platform for tracking your Job Applications


💼**Introducing JobTracker – My Job Application Tracking App**
As a fresher, I know how overwhelming it feels to mass-apply to dozens (sometimes hundreds) of jobs across multiple job portals. Keeping track of all those applications can quickly become tedious and confusing. 
Thats why, I built JobTracker 🎉 — a simple yet powerful application to help you stay organized and track your job applications effectively.

✨ **Key Features**  
🗓️ **Monthly Analytics** – visualize the number of applications submitted each month  
📈 **Application Stats** – track success, rejection, and pending rates  
📊 **Applications by Status** – quickly see how many are under review, shortlisted, or rejected  
🗂️ **Kanban Board** – move applications across different stages for better clarity  
⌚ **Timeline View** – follow the progress of each application over time  
🗒️ **Notes Section** – scribble down important details for each application  
🔍 **Detailed View** – get all key info about a specific application at a glance

After registering and logging in, you’ll land on a clean **dashboard** that brings everything together, helping you analyze, plan, and stay on top of your job hunt.

🚀 **Tech Stack Used**
🌐 **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, TanStack Query, Axios  
💻 **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
🗄️ **Database:** MongoDB

I built this project to solve a problem I personally faced, and I hope it can help many job seekers out there ✨
